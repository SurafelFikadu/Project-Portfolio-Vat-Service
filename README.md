# VatService Calculator ~ Everything become simpler

![Customers in resturant](./src/img/bg-img-5.png);

## INTRODUCTION

    In Ethiopa when anything is sold or bought, a 15% tax is paid to the

government. When is comes to hotel and resturants, customers pay 10% service
charge in addation to 15% tax after using the service. This service charge
accured and added to the employee's salary at the end of the month.

    Usually when I go to cafe and resturant and look at the menu, the price

on the menu does not include tax and service charge. So I have seen many
customers who even see at the menu and find it difficult to know whether the
service in their pocket is enough for the service they want or not.
Especially if they think they don't have enough money.

Because of this uncertainty, they may end up using something they don't want.

And this portfolio project allows customers to know for sure what the total
price will be, including service charge and vat, after looking the menu.

<!-- This is a simple web app that used to calculate the total amount incuding vat and service charge if there is no service charge you can put on the value of service charge 0 or none.

I make this app specially for cafe and restaurant customers that is why I included service charge. -->
